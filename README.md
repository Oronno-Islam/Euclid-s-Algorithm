# Euclid-s-Algorithm
Eulid's Algorithm is one of the oldest algorithm in use today. This method was developed by Euclid of Alexandria. It appeared in his book named "Elements". I have written my Euclid's Algorithm in python in 2 method. 
In first case I have used basic tools of programming like loop, conditional and function. 
In second case I have used concept of recursion to write it. 
If you have any advice or improvement feel free to contact me.
